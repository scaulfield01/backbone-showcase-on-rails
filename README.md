# Backbone Showcase
The showcase is a nice single-page application that lets you keep track of the shows you've seen and your rating for them. A show has a title, one genre, and 1-5 stars (★★★★★). 

Most of the functionality is not implemented. It's up to you to make this showcase a reality and show off how much TV you've watched. The JavaScript code has comments to help guide the implementation. 

## Release 0
Look at questions.txt. As you work through the challenge, fill out answers to the five questions and commit questions.txt with your responses. 

## Release 1
Use localStorage as your persistent data store and set up the Backbone application so that you can add and delete shows from your showcase. There's a sample show on the index page that should give an idea of what the app should look like. 

## Release 2
Migrate your application from localStorage to a Rails API backend. 

## Release 3
Add an Edit button which causes a form to be displayed on the show card with fields corresponding to the show's title, genre, and stars. When that form is submitted, the edited values from the form should be persisted for that show. No function stubs for this feature -- you'll have to figure out which events and functions to use.
